# Text-image-to-digital-text<br />
Trained a Deep learing model with EMIST dataset to convert handwritten image to digital text <br />

Trained CNN model with EMNIST dataset<br />
Read the input image<br />
pre-process the image to get the text better<br /> 
With threshold kernel and dilated find out the text<br />
contours  helps to crop the image <br />
croped image is converted into np array <br />
input np array is given to the model to predict the digital text<br />
digital text is saved in the notepad<br />
